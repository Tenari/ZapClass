It's so simple there's nothing to do with it. x = 3. You might call this a no-step equation. But if I change the equation, like so, then there is something to do, and it becomes a simple one-step equation. This equation is so simple you probably don't really have to do any steps.

A very easy one, yes. Let me show you what you actually did. You knew that you needed to get x by itself. So, you focused on removing the \"1 +\" next to it. To remove a + 1, you needed to subtract one.
