It's quite common. This is another way. It's common on computers. This way is also fairly common in algebra. This way, we didn't even write a multiplication symbol, it's just obvious from the fact that the 3 is right next to the parentheses that it means multiplication. So, see if you can pick which one is not a way to write multiplication.","audio":"/sounds/a_mult-formats_B0_1","correct":{"answer":"3 : 4","points":"1","audio":"/sounds/a_mult-formats_B0_2","help":"Correct!

That x looks an awful lot like the times symbol, doesn't it? So, when we multiply by a variable, the most common way of writing it is just 3x. Notice how the number goes in front. This is just the format, the normal way of doing it.
